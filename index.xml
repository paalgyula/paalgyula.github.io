      <description>SSH - Secure Shell SSH (Secure SHell) is an encrypted terminal program that replaces the classic telnet tool on Unix-like operating systems.
In addition to remote terminal access provided by the main ssh binary, the SSH suite of programs has grown to include other tools such as SCP (Secure Copy Program) and SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol).
SFTP - Secure File Transfer Protocol The SSH File Transfer Protocol (also Secure File Transfer Protocol, or SFTP) is a network protocol that provides file access, file transfer, and file management over any reliable data stream.</description>

      <description>SSH Tweaks/tricks SSH public key authentication Introduction Public-key authentication with Secure Shell is more secure than password authentication, as it provides much stronger identity checking. An entity must possess both the private key and the correct passphrase to authenticate itself to another entity.
Generating your keypair be sure that ~/.ssh/id_rsa doesnt exists or this command will override it!
 ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C &amp;quot;youremail@yourdomain.com&amp;quot;  This creates a new ssh key, using the provided email as a label.</description>

      <description>Introduction The frustration of getting falsely flagged as a spammer is not strange to most of the mail server admins. By excluding the possibility of a compromised server, a false flag is usually caused by one of the following:
 the server is an open mail relay the sender&amp;rsquo;s or server&amp;rsquo;s IP address is blacklisted the server does not have a FQDN and a PTR record the Sender Policy Framework (SPF) DNS record is missing or it is misconfigured the DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) implementation is missing or it&amp;rsquo;s not properly set up These are some of the basic properties that are being checked by the majority of proprietary and open source spam filters (including SpamAssassin).</description>

      <description>The domain name system (DNS) is the way that internet domain names are located and translated into internet protocol (IP) addresses. The domain name system maps the name people use to locate a website to the IP address that a computer uses to locate a website. For example, if someone types www.google.com into a web browser, a server behind the scenes will map that name to the IP address 216.</description>

      <description>An open mail relay is an SMTP server configured in such a way that it allows anyone on the Internet to send e-mail through it, not just mail destined to or originating from known users. This used to be the default configuration in many mail servers; indeed, it was the way the Internet was initially set up, but open mail relays have become unpopular because of their exploitation by spammers and worms.</description>
